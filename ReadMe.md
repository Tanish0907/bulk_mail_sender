Thanks! Based on your script, here's a clean and professional `README.md` you can use:

# 📧 Google Sheets Email Automation

This Python script automates the process of sending emails based on data from a Google Sheet. It reads user data from the sheet, checks if an email should be sent based on a "Yes" value, and sends an email using a custom `mail()` function.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Connects to a Google Sheet using service account credentials
- Retrieves data with `pandas`
- Logs all operations (success and errors)
- Sends emails conditionally based on data from the sheet

## 📁 Project Structure

```
.
├── data/
│   └── credentials.json       # Google service account credentials
├── mail.py                    # Custom mail function (must define `mail(email)`)
├── main_script.py             # Your main script (shown above)
└── README.md
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sheets-email-automation.git
cd sheets-email-automation
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install gspread oauth2client pandas
```

### 3. Set up Google Sheets API

- Create a service account in Google Cloud
- Share the Google Sheet with the service account email
- Download and save the credentials JSON file as `./data/credentials.json`

### 4. Prepare your Google Sheet

- Your sheet should have at least these columns: `Name`, `Email`, `test`
- The `test` column should contain `"Yes"` or `"No"` for whether to send an email

---

## 📨 Sending Emails

Make sure your `mail.py` has a function like:

```python
def mail(email):
    # your email-sending logic
    pass
```

Run the script:

```bash
python main_script.py
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Authenticates with Google Sheets API using the service account
2. Fetches all data from `sheet1`
3. Filters and zips `Name`, `Email`, and `test` fields
4. Sends an email only if `test == "Yes"`

---

## 📋 Logging

Logs are printed to the console with timestamps and severity levels. You’ll see messages like:

- `INFO - Data retrieved successfully.`
- `ERROR - Error sending email: ...`

---

## 📬 Example Output

```
[('user1@example.com', 'Alice', 'Yes'), ('user2@example.com', 'Bob', 'No')]
Email sent to Alice at user1@example.com
Email not sent to Bob at user2@example.com
```
